# Song Downloader Script

This Python script allows you to download songs from a specified website (Tidal) using Playwright and Google Chrome. You can either provide the song name directly or use a text file containing song names to download multiple tracks. The script supports downloading music in various high-quality formats, including:

- **Hi-Res 16-bit** audio
- **Hi-Res 24-bit** audio
- **Lossless audio**

## Requirements

Before running the script, you must have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x** (Preferably Python 3.7 or above)
- **Google Chrome**: The script uses Chromium (Google Chrome) via Playwright. Make sure you have Google Chrome installed on your system. If not, download it from [Google Chrome's official site](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
- **Playwright**: The script utilizes Playwright, a Node.js-based browser automation library, to interact with the website and download the songs.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   - First, ensure you have Python installed. You can check by running `python --version` in the terminal.
   - Install Playwright and its dependencies by running the following command:

     ```bash
     pip install playwright
     python -m playwright install
     ```

2. **Download Google Chrome**:
   - If you do not have Google Chrome installed, download and install it from [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
   - The script requires Google Chrome to work properly, as it launches the Chromium browser during execution.

3. **Clone the Repository** (or place the script in a folder of your choice).

## Usage

### Command Line

You can run the script from the command line by specifying the song name or a file containing a list of songs:

#### Option 1: Download a Single Song

You can run the script and provide a song name interactively (the script will prompt you for it):

````bash
python download_song.py

## Option 2: Download Songs from a File

You can create a text file (e.g., `songs.txt`) with a list of song names (one per line). Then, you can provide the path to this file:

```bash
python download_song.py path/to/songs.txt
````

**Note: Each song name in the text file should be on a separate line. The script will read through the file, download each song, and save it to your default downloads folder.**

## Audio Quality Options

The script allows you to download music in the following audio formats:

- Hi-Res 16-bit: Offers a high-quality audio experience with a bit depth of 16-bit.

* Hi-Res 24-bit: For audiophiles who prefer the best possible quality, this option provides 24-bit depth.

* Lossless Audio: The script downloads lossless audio, meaning no quality loss during compression, for the best sound fidelity.

## Script Behavior

- The script will open a Chromium browser window (not headless) and navigate to the website to search and download the song.

* The song will be saved in your default Downloads folder in the format you choose (16-bit, 24-bit, or lossless).

* If a song name or file is invalid, the script will notify you with an error message.

## Troubleshooting

- "File Not Found" Error: Make sure the file path to the text file is correct if you're using a text file.

- Missing Google Chrome: If you get errors related to Chrome not being found, ensure Google Chrome is installed on your system.

- Audio Quality Issues: Ensure that the song you are trying to download is available in the desired quality (Hi-Res 16-bit, Hi-Res 24-bit, or Lossless). If not, the script may default to a lower quality.
